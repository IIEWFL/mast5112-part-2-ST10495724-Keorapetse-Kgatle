Christoffel's Menu
It is a mobile app made to help a private chef, Christoffel, manage his food menu in a fast and effortless way. The app works on both Android and iPhone. Christoffel often changes his dishes depending on the season, the client, or the event, so he needs a tool that lets him update his menu quickly and clearly. This app gives him that control, the chef can add new dishes by typing in the name, a brief description, the type of course (like starter, main, or dessert), and the price. Once added, all the dishes appear on the home screen, where Christoffel can see the full list of items. The app also shows how many dishes are on the menu and gives the average price for each course, which helps him plan and price his meals better.
If Christoffel wants to focus on one type of dish, like just the starters, he can use the filter screen to only show those items. If a dish is no longer available, he can remove it from the menu with one tap. The app is designed to be simple and clean, with buttons that are easy to press and screens that feel warm and welcoming. It uses soft colours and clear layouts to make sure the chef, and his clients feel comfortable using it. The app uses smart code to keep everything organized, it saves the menu items in an array, uses functions to calculate averages, and separates the code into different files to keep things neat. It also uses loops and global variables to handle tasks like counting items and showing prices. All of this makes the app strong, reliable, and easy to update in the future.
Christoffel’s Menu isn’t just a tool it’s part of the chef’s daily rhythm. It helps him stay focused, feel proud of his work, and deliver a smooth experience to every client.
